if option == "Generate Resume":
        st.subheader("Generate Resume")
        name = st.text_input("Enter your name")
        experience = st.number_input("Enter your years of experience", min_value=0, step=1)
        skills = st.text_area("Enter your skills")
        projects = st.text_area("Enter your projects")
        education = st.text_area("Enter your education")
        awards = st.text_area("Enter your awards and recognition")

if st.button("Generate"): 
                if name and experience and skills and projects and education and awards:
                    resume = generate_resume(name, experience, skills, projects, education, awards)
                    st.write(resume)
                else:
                    st.warning("Please fill in all the fields.")



#3 defining the generate_resume function to call the model

def generate_resume(name, experience, skills, projects, education, awards):
    prompt = f"My name is {name}. I have {experience} years of experience in {skills}."
    prompt += f"\n\nProjects:\n{projects}\n\nEducation:\n{education}\n\nAwards and Recognition:\n{awards}"
    response = palm.generate_text(model=model_name, prompt=prompt)
    return response.result
